# Privacy Policy
Exalt ("we" or "us") operates a Discord bot (the "Bot"). This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the information we collect from you when you use the Bot.

## Information We Collect
When you use the Bot, we collect the user ID of your Discord account. We do not collect any other personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.

## Use of Information
We use the user IDs collected from the Bot to provide our users with the requested services. The Bot operates as a game, so user IDs are used to mark the owners of each "save file". We do not share or sell any of the user IDs collected from the Bot to any third party.

## Data Retention
We retain the user IDs collected from the Bot for as long as necessary to provide the Bot to our users.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the user IDs collected from the Bot from loss, theft, unauthorized access, and misuse.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our website or GitHub repository. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice on our website or GitHub repository prior to the effective date of the changes. By continuing to use the Bot after the effective date of any changes to this Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by the updated Privacy Policy.
